# Requirements
We have an EVM Smart Contract and its description. We would like to replicate the same features on the Solana blockchain. Please refer to the `EVM-ICO-Launchpad` and develop a similar solution for Solana.

## Materials
Here is the demo frontend for the EVM version:
https://fushuma-launchpad.vercel.app/ \
Developers should be knowledgeable about common ICO and launchpad terminology.

## Notes
We aim to utilize both `spl-token` and `spl-token-2022`. The Solana contract should be capable of handling both types of tokens, including Wrapped SOL (WSOL). \
Additionally, we request the development and deployment of the smart contract on the devnet, along with a provided Web3 script library. \
It would be ideal if the contract is fully tested and well-documented.
